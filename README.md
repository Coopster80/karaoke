### Web App Features
- Search by artist, song title, or contributor
- See all songs which match the criteria from the search page, including all versions of each song
- Choose a version of the song to enter into either the free or accelerated queue
- Enter a credit card number and an amount to pay for the accelerated queue
- Show the queues for the DJ, allowing the DJ to flag songs as played
- Already played songs will no longer show in the queue, but will remain present in the database

### Process
1. Create an ER diagram which accurately models the database needed to implement the application
2. Convert the ER Diagram into a relational schema
3. Create and run an SQL script which will create the tables from the relational schema
4. Think up some sample data and insert it into the SQL tables
5. Implement the web application using PHP
